jServe
======

jServe is an HTTP Server that I have been developing in the footsteps of some of the big name web servers like Apache and nginx.  It is not meant to be a viable web server... just an educational project to keep my Java knowledge sharp as I continue working in other languages like Ruby and PHP. 

About
=====

It is always fun to take an old project that you really loved and see where you were just a short while ago.  I started jServe in high school when I was learning Java in 2012. After I finished JChat, I wanted to build something massive.  jServe is a multithreaded web server built in Java that has helped me learn concepts in Java and general programming in a real application that I enjoy writing.  I know that web servers aren't a new thing, there are a lot of great ones out there already, but that's why I wanted to write jServe, so that I could try my hand at building something that is capable of serving of the most integral parts of the internet: Websites

Support
=======

This was an academic project and I don't intend for this to be used in the "real world".  If you are interested in how it works by all means check it out, but I cannot support this project at this time.

Bugs and Contributing
=====================

I am aware of a ton of issues with this project, the list is huge.  Because this is a personal educational project I do not believe that I will be publishing issues in an issue tracker, just TODO comments for IntelliJ to pickup.  If you are looking to use this code and really want a bug fixed:

1. Fork ( maybe star :) )
2. Fix
3. Pull Request (only using master branch for now)
