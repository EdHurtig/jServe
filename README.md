jServe
======

A lightwieght multithreaded web server built in java

About
=====

This project was created for my Java Programming class at LSRHS (Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School) in 2013.  
It is a functional web server that will serve websites to client browsers.

Support
=======

This was an acedemic project and I don't intend for this to be used in the "real world".  If you are interested
in how it works by all means check it out, but I cannot support this project at this time.

Bugs
====

I am aware of a ton of issues with this project, most relating to the HTTP protocaol headers. I would love to fix
them at some point, but again this was an acedemic project from high school that I can't support.
